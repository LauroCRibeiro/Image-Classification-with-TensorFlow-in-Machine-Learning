Image Classification with Tensorflow in Machine LearningÂ¶
Image classification is the process of categorizing and labelling groups of pixels or vectors in an image according to specific rules. The categorization law can be designed using one or more spectral or textural characteristics.

It can also be done by using less complex models provided by Scikit-Learn, so why TensorFlow. By using TensorFlow we can build a neural network for the task of Image Classification. By building a neural network we can discover more hidden patterns than just classification.
